# Cryptography

This is a program that I am creating to show implementations of Cryptology over time. It will start with simple ciphers that were originally pen-on-paper and it will end with modern cryptographic algorithms. The program will give a challenge for each of the ciphers that is posible for people to solve by hand. It will also contain some simple example applications for cryptology in modern day.

## Included Ciphers and Algorithms
Each cipher and algorithm has it's own class in the CryptoLib project you can find all the code for encryption, decryption, and the challenge for it in the class for the desired cipher/algorithm.
