# Cryptography

This is the repository for my Genius Project for my UConn ECE English course. This is a program that I am creating to show implementations of Cryptology over time. It will start with simple ciphers that were originally pen-on-paper and it will end with modern cryptographic algorithms. The program will give a challenge for each of the ciphers that is posible for people to solve by hand. It will also contain some simple example applications for cryptology in modern day.

This program when completed will be a simple WinForms application. It will be able to encrypt and decrypt text using any of the ciphers and algorithms that I select to be coded into this program.

## Included Ciphers and Algorithms
Each cipher and algorithm has it's own class in the CryptoLib project you can find all the code for encryption, decryption, and the challenge for it in the class for the desired cipher/algorithm.

- Caesar Cipher
- Affine Cipher
- Rail-Fence Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- The Enigma Machine
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- Triple DES
- Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
- Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5)
- 

## Examples Applications and Uses of Cryptology
- End to End Encryption
