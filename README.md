# Cryptography

This is the repository for my Genius Project for my ECE English class. This is a program that I am creating to show implementations of Cryptography over time. It will start with simple ciphers that were originally pen-on-paper and it will end with modern cryptographic algorithms.

This program when completed will have an universal .NET Core console application and a WinForms gui application.
