# Cryptography

This is the repository for my Genius Project for my ECE English class. This is a program that I am creating to show implementations of Cryptography over time. It will start with simple ciphers that were originally pen-on-paper and it will end with modern cryptographic algorithms.

This program when completed will have an universal .NET Core console application and a WinForms gui application. It will be able to encrypt and decrypt text using any of the ciphers and algorithms that I select to be coded into this program.

## Included Ciphers and Algorithms
Each cipher and algorithm has it's own class in the CryptoLib project you can find all the code for encryption and decryption in the class for the desired cipher/algorithm.
